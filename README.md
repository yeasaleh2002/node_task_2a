Redis:

https://redis.io/docs/connect/clients/nodejs/

https://www.npmjs.com/package/redis

In demo what should happen:
If I open 2 browsers to /chat, both users should connect to chat room. Use redis to store state of chatroom.
Have basic html ui showing the chat log using UL and single input box with send button to send messages.
When I type a message in send message, call /send POST api to send message to backend. The chat room is updated with new message.
All client browsers have an api called /poll that check if chat room on redis is updated. If updated, it will return 200 and frontend
need to call GET /chat/all to pull all the messages in chat room which you will update the UL. Have a button called save where it will save the current chat room chat messages to database table chat with fields (id, create_at, chat_messages).
